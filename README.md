# Customer-Segmenatation-by-Kmeans.ipynb
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and standardizes data to prepare for clustering.

Elbow Method: Determines the optimal number of clusters by analyzing the inertia values.

K-Means Clustering: Groups the customers into distinct clusters based on their similarity.

Visualization: Provides scatter plots to visualize the clusters.

Export Results: Saves the clustered dataset as a CSV file.



Dependencies

Python 3.7+

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn


Output

Elbow Plot: Helps identify the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Visualization: Scatter plot of clusters in a 2D space.

Clustered Dataset: The dataset with an additional Cluster column indicating the assigned cluster.
